Interesting, timely and ambitious work, on-topic for NetPL. From 
the description it wasn't clear to me what the workflow consists 
of when refining the specification -- what does the user see and 
think? And who is the intended user -- network engineers? How does 
this scale -- how long does the model checker take in realistic 
applications?
